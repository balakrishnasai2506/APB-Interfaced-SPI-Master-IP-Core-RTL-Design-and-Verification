# APB-Interfaced-SPI-Master-IP-Core-RTL-Design-and-Verification

## Overview

This repository contains the Register Transfer Level (RTL) design and verification of an **SPI Master IP Core** integrated with the **Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)** interface. The SPI protocol is widely used for synchronous serial communication in embedded systems, and this project aims to implement a configurable SPI Master core capable of communicating with SPI slave devices through the APB interface.

## Project Status

- ‚úÖ RTL Design Completed  
- üîÑ Currently working on UVM-based Verification  
- ‚è≥ Verification environment and test cases will be uploaded upon completion

## Key Features

- APB-compliant interface for easy integration with AMBA-based SoCs  
- SPI Master functionality supporting key SPI modes and parameters  
- Parameterized and modular Verilog design  
- Designed for synthesis and simulation compatibility  
- Verification planned using **SystemVerilog + UVM** methodology
